    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to critically analyze\n",
    "the limitations of linear face recognition methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than improving performance, we focus on understanding\n",
    "when and why the eigenface-based approach fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is essential for a realistic interpretation\n",
    "of linear models in machine learning."

    "\n",
    "Errors in face recognition generally fall into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **False acceptance**: a non-matching face is incorrectly accepted\n",
    "- **False rejection**: a matching face is incorrectly rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "In the eigenface framework, both types of errors\n",
    "are governed by the distance threshold and the structure\n",
    "of the learned subspace."

    "\n",
    "One of the main failure modes of eigenfaces\n",
    "is sensitivity to lighting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in illumination often introduce large pixel-wise differences\n",
    "that dominate variance, even though identity remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result:\n",
    "- illumination variation may be captured as a principal component\n",
    "- identity-related features may be suppressed"

    "- Eigenfaces provide an interpretable, linear face model.\n",

    "- Illumination, pose, and expression expose fundamental limitations.\n",
    "- Identity cannot be fully captured by linear pixel-based models.\n",
