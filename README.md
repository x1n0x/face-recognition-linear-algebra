# face-recognition-linear-algebra
This project explores face recognition from a linear algebra perspective. Facial images are treated as vectors in a high-dimensional space, while identity is modeled as a linear subspace learned via PCA (Eigenfaces). All core methods are implemented from scratch using NumPy, with emphasis on geometry, and limitations of linear models.
